# A scalable mass testing approach to curb COVID-19

## Benefits
* Efficient use of test kits by testing those contributing to infections the most
* Built-in compliance enforcement where needed the most
* Minimal overhead for testing procedures
* Requires no quarantine
* Decentralized, non-digital implementation possible, avoiding issues with data protection acts

## Prerequisites
* Government support
* Availability of (many) test kits

## Basic Protocol
* Risk areas control access based on a negative test certificate, valid for 2-3 days.
* Risk areas e.g. are: Schools, public transport, retail, medical services, care homes, restaurants, other buisinesses.
* Where feasible, risk areas provide testing facilities, basically for their regular visitors, but generally for all.

## Implementation
* Everyone obtains a monthly form, containing their ID (name, residence) and a square for each day of the month.
* After a test, the testing facility stamps that form: 
** For negative tests in the square of the last day the test is valid.
** For positive tests in the square of the first day a new test can be applied for.
